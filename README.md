middleware for a blackbox api (ESE Assignment) 

For my Enterprise Software Engineering Class we created an api from scratch. 

The purpose of this api was to grab files (pdf files) from a black box database that our professor had. He gave each of us an individual log in specifically for each student so that way he could keep track of what files we were getting. 

Another task we did for this assignment was to create a cronjob to automatically run at the same time each day. We were supposed to be collecting files each day to gather enough data to conduct research on and run queries via our phpmyadmin sql. 

All of the files had different aspects to it. The first component of the name consisted of loan number and each loan umber had to have 8 other types of files.  

For our last assignment we were to organize this data. How many files did we read in ? How many loan numbers had a complete set of files? How many loan files were missing some files and what files were they missing?
